 * @param keepSmallest A boolean flag that indicates whether to keep the smallest rectangle (true)

 *
 * @note The function assumes that the rects vector contains unique rectangles. 
 * Rectangles whose centers are exactly the same will not be compared.

/**
 * @brief Computes the normalized intersection area between two rotated rectangles.

 * normalizes it by dividing by the smaller of the two rectangle areas. The normalization ensures that the 
 * intersection area is represented as a ratio, where 1 means complete overlap and 0 means no overlap.
 *
 * The function first extracts the corner points of both rectangles, then uses OpenCV's 
 * `cv::intersectConvexConvex` to find the intersection polygon. The area of this intersection is divided by the 
 * smaller of the two original rectangle areas.
 *
 * @param rect1 The first rotated rectangle.
 * @param rect2 The second rotated rectangle.
 * @return The normalized intersection area as a ratio in the range [0, 1], where 1 indicates complete overlap
 *         and 0 indicates no intersection.
